# Fake-Image-Detection
 iFake Image Detection s a deep learning-based system for detecting fake or manipulated images using advanced neural networks. This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and other deep learning techniques to analyze image authenticity by identifying inconsistencies such as artifacts, deepfake patterns, and image manipulation traces
